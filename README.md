# Scripts for analysis in PopGenome

Testing for F_ST, Tajima.D, and other neutrality statistics. 

## F_ST Fixation Index
A measure of differentiation in population by looking at the proportion of the total genetic variance contained in a subpopulation relative to the total genetic variance. 
FST values range from 0-1, with higher values meaning higher differentiation among populations. 

## Tajima.D
Often used for detecting selective sweeps.
